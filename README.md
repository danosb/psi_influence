Experiments to measure impact of intention on random numbers generators. 

There are a several different types of experiments here of varying levels of sophistication. 

Also a number of different devices are used, represented by unique subfolders.


and each using different sources for random numbers used. The different random number generator types are captured in subfolders.

The med100kx8 folders encapsulated the most mature iteration of these experiments.
