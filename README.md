# quantum_influence
An experiment to measure impact of intention on quantum random numbers

## Summary

Previous experiments, mostly done by Helmut Schmidt in the 70s and 80s, suggest that prior to being observed random numbers can be influenced by intention. Once the random numbers have been observed they no longer appear to be open to influence. This is important because it is the strongest evidence indicating that the observer plays an active role in the quantum mechanical process of collapsing a wave-function from all probable outcomes (existing in a superposition) into a single actual outcome (eigenstate). While an area of active debate with no direct experimental evidence, such a suggestion is in stark contrast to the commonly accepted viewpoint amongst quantum physcists, who assert that the observer plays no role and instead the act of measurement itself, or more specifcailly interaction with a measuring device, is what causes wave-function collapse.

This debate is incredibly important because it deals with the point at which our world stops being a cloud of possibilities and becomes an actual physical thing. It's a core question underpinning our understanding of reality, and likely represents the missing link between what are currently our two completely different and allegedly unrelated sets of physics (quantum vs classical). 

As such, I believe this experiment is the strongest indicator we have to point us towards the role played by consciousness in formation of our physical world, a connection most commonly believed to not exist. 

There are a several different types of experiments here, and three different sources for random numbers used. The different random number generator types are captured in subfolder.

/geiger/Geiger2.py is the latest, and optionally uses all three random number sources together.
